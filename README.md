## Introduction
This project aims to showcase the integration of technologies to build an intelligent and interactive chatbot. The main focus is to take advantage of Llama 2 as open source Large Language Model developed by Meta AI as introduced in their [website](https://ai.meta.com/llama/). It is available for free for research and commercial use. While building with Llama 2, this repository is intended to leverage its factual accuracy and consistency by providing it with reliable and up-to-date information from the knowledge base. That means this model would need integrations with external database that could be used to store such novel information.
